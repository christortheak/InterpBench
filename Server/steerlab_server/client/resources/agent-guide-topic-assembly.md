# Assembling a study from reviewed pieces

These verbs write only what you reviewed: each takes the SHA-256 of the file
it read, and refuses if the file changed in between. Inspect, review, then
write.

**Agent attachment:** `steerlab agent list --json` lists discoverable local
agents; `steerlab agent inspect <path> --json` returns the artifact and
`artifactFileSHA256`. Inspect the target with `steerlab experiment inspect <name> --json`
(it returns `document` and `manifestFileSHA256`), then use
`steerlab experiment attach-agent <name> --artifact <path> --artifact-sha256 <digest> --manifest-sha256 <digest> --json`.
Both digests come from the reviewed files. The service computes the
condition's pin; never invent one. A changed file refuses, as does a frozen
study or wrong base model. Inspect and review the changes before
reconstructing an attachment request.

**Renaming and deleting:** `steerlab experiment rename <name> <new-name>`,
`steerlab experiment delete <name>`, `steerlab design rename <name> <new-name>`,
`steerlab design delete <name>` (templates), and `steerlab agent delete <path>`
preview by default: each prints what would change and the reviewed digest, and
writes nothing. Show the researcher the preview and apply only after they agree,
by repeating the command with that digest (`--manifest-sha256`, `--file-sha256`,
or `--artifact-sha256`) and `--yes`; `result.confirmCommand` is the exact
command. A changed file refuses; preview again. Only a draft study can be renamed
or deleted: a frozen or complete one refuses with `statusImmutable`, and the
repair is to duplicate it. A delete moves the item into a `.trash-<time>` folder
beside it, where it can be recovered. Nothing in `runs/` changes, and a study's
runs keep the name they recorded. An agent any study uses refuses with
`agentInUse` and names the studies; an agent a run saved refuses with
`agentIsRunEvidence`, because run folders are evidence. Never rename or delete
these by hand.

**Concept-to-draft assembly:** `steerlab authoring study conceptStudy --json`
(or `agentComparison` / `multiAgent`) emits the same study interview used by the
app. Discuss substantive choices first; use `authoring prompt <kind>` for exact
dataset-generation and independent-review instructions. Save the delivered
study pack as JSON, then run `steerlab pack preview <file> --json`. Inspect
its file plan and advisories; pass the returned `reviewSHA256` to
`steerlab pack apply <file> --review-sha256 <digest> --json`. Changed files,
workspace or pack text require another review. Apply creates a draft, pins real
input bytes and reports `verificationIssues`; import success is not permission
to skip verification or freeze gates.

`pack export <study> --json` returns a pack plus external artifact dependencies;
it is not a model/vector execution bundle. Full-record prompt updates use
`experiment import-prompts <study> --file <jsonl> --manifest-sha256 <digest> --json`:
records become immutable input versions, preserving prior study inputs.

**Vector attachment:** `steerlab experiment inspect-artifact <path> --json`
reads an existing vector pair's sidecar and both file digests. Then use
`steerlab experiment attach-artifact <study> <concept> --artifact <path> --artifact-sha256 <digest> --sidecar-sha256 <digest> --manifest-sha256 <digest> --json`.
The path is workspace-relative; frozen runs and vector files are read-only.
The same inspected bytes must still exist when attaching. This uses the store's
scientific admission, including residual-norm and substrate requirements;
inspection alone does not certify attachability. Supply `--source-concept` or `--eval-run` only when
required by the artifact's provenance, never to bypass a refusal.

Keep preview and apply on the same client, in the same workspace: review
tokens are authoring preconditions, not portable scientific identifiers. The
client preserves complete prompt records and uses its scientific store for
vector admission, including substrate restrictions.

## Mirroring a direction

This client has no `vectors` family, so it cannot mint the opposite pole of a
contrastive direction as an artifact of its own. A negative strength (α) in a
condition is available instead; say in your report that the arm is a negative
dose of the concept, not a separately authored opposite pole.
